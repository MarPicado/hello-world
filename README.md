Hello team!

I am Margoth, I live in Costa Rica and right now, I am studying coding at 4Geeks Academy.
I like it very much, mainly because it's an online program.
My favorite movie is Hidden Figures.
I enjoy eating chicken wraps, home made food and fresh fruits.
One of my favorite sports is badminton, but I also like functional exercises (if it's outdoors, even better LOL).
